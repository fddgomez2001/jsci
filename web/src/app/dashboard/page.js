Format: SONG TITLE - ARTIST

Rules:
- Output the song name first in UPPERCASE, then " - ", then the artist name in UPPERCASE
- Remove any extra info like "(Official Video)", "(Lyrics)", "(Live)", "[Official Music Video]", "HD", "Audio", "ft.", "feat.", etc.
- If the video title has "Artist - Song", reverse it to "SONG - ARTIST"
- If you cannot determine the artist from the title, use the YouTube channel name as the artist
- For worship/gospel songs, the artist is usually the worship leader or band name
- Keep featured artist info like "ft." out of the result

Examples:
- Input: "Don Moen - Our Father | Live Worship Sessions" by DonMoenTV → OUR FATHER - DON MOEN
- Input: "Friend of God - Israel Houghton (Official)" by Churchome → FRIEND OF GOD - ISRAEL HOUGHTON
- Input: "Planetshakers - Joy" by Planetshakers → JOY - PLANETSHAKERS
- Input: "Way Maker - Sinach [Official Video]" by Sinach → WAY MAKER - SINACH
